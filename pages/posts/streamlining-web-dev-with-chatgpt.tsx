            Idea Generation and Brainstorming
          </h2>
          <p className="text-md mb-4">
            One of the most daunting tasks in web development is starting with
            the right idea. ChatGPT acts as a 24/7 available brainstorming
            partner, helping to flesh out ideas for website themes,
            functionalities, and user experience improvements. Whether you're
            sketching the initial design or seeking inspiration for innovative
            features, ChatGPT can provide a flow of ideas based on the latest
            trends and proven user engagement strategies.

            Debugging and Code Snippets
          </h2>
          <p className="text-md mb-4">
            Debugging is often a time-consuming and frustrating phase of
            development. ChatGPT can simplify this process by suggesting
            solutions and offering code snippets in various programming
            languages. This can drastically reduce the time spent on bug-fixing
            and troubleshooting.

          <p className="text-md mb-4">
            Here's an example conversation where I used ChatGPT to help me debug
            an issue I was getting in my React / NextJS application:

            element is nested directly inside a {'<p>'} (paragraph) element,
            which is not valid HTML. The {'<p>'} tag should not contain block

              GitHub Copilot, powered by OpenAI’s Codex, serves as an AI pair
              programmer that suggests whole lines or blocks of code as you
              type, adapting to the way you write code to help you complete your
              work faster. Copilot is designed to understand the context of your
              code, making programming with unfamiliar libraries or frameworks
              much easier. When used in conjunction with ChatGPT, developers can
              leverage the strengths of both: Copilot for code completion and
              ChatGPT for high-level explanations and debugging assistance.
